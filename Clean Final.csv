582,1,4,4,1,8,The AI considers a lot of different factors which a single person would struggle to take into account. I think this method of deciding who receives treatment and when is less subjective and therefore more fair.,7,I understand that the AI assigns a weight to several different factors which influences when or if a person is treated. I think these factors are weighted differently depending on how big of an influence they have on a person's likelihood to get better.,8,"It takes into account a wide range of factors, including aspects such as how severe a condition is and how long patients have been waiting to receive treatment.",6,I do but only if the final decision is given a second opinion by specialists.,2,8,9,7,28,7,2,4,35,0,6

278,1,2,2,1,9,I think it is very hard to make a non bias decision especially if you know the patient personally.,10,The AI takes in all medical information into account to make a decision about who to prioritise for treatment,10,The AI decides who more urgently requires treatment which is the fairest way to decide who gets treatment first as it could be life threating,9,I'm sure it would be testing to a high standard so I would definitely trust the AI to make an informed and accurate decision,8,6,8,6,30,2,2,4,32,0,6

331,1,2,2,1,7,It depends on the situation and AI as of right now I don't think is trained enough to be able to make 100% right decisions regarding what can people's lives,4,"Kind of, I did a university course on the subject but I don't consider myself expert enough on the topic",8,It is since it doesn't have any personal attachment to it,6,"I believe that some human touch should be in it, when I think of AI I think about some sort of cold blooded figure without empathy or little of it",9,1,2,10,25,2,2,1,29,20,2

359,2,3,7,1,8,"With the use of AI, the Lead Officier has a great overview of information needed to form a decision. Even though these numbers don't guarantee a criminal won't commit a felony again, it gives a proper overview and shows who needs support.",7,"As far as I'm concerned, the AI takes a look at gathered data and looks at the extent to which someone needs support most. I'm fairly certain a convicted person's numbers need to meet certain requirements.",6,I do not fully agree because numbers are not always representative for someone's behaviour. I think a second opinion by a real person is needed to keep it fair,7,"Yes, as long as rules are set by real humans I don't think AI can make very wrong decisions. ",8,8,8,8,19,5,2,1,25,1,6
375,1,4,4,1,3,Using AL to help with decision making may be a disadvantage to some patients needing help urgently ,4,I don't agree with all the factors the AL considers. ,5,I am in the middle with this one because I believe that it might not be fair in every situation and to every patient needing help urgently. ,5,I do. However I acknowledge that it might not always make the right decision ,8,10,8,10,23,4,2,1,61,80,1
354,1,3,3,1,7,AI is more objective,6,Nothing to explain here,6,It depends on how it was programmed and if all important variables were put in ,6,Depends on how well it was programmed,10,10,10,10,38,6,2,10,1,1,6

345,1,2,2,1,9,I believe the AI could help the Lead Consultant with getting him all the data and information he would need to decide faster and more organized.,6,I think it gathers all the information it has and then decide which case is the priority,3,depends on what the AI considers as fair,2,"Not really, i would still prefer for the consultant to make the final decision",10,10,10,10,25,5,1,1,20,9,6

496,1,3,3,1,8,I agree as the AI can make fair informed decisions,9,The AI use a range of important factors to make decisions ,8,AI makes use of many different factors to make its decision which is necessary when working with different patients with different medical problems ,6,I am skeptical of AI making these decisions ,0,10,0,10,20,2,2,1,30,50,7
398,1,2,2,1,5,I feel it's person dependant whether or not they choose to use AI to help. Technology is a wonderful thing but it also has its faults and with that people may not have faith in the performance of the AI system. A lead consultant may feel the only person best to determine who needs to receive care first is themselves and their medical team,7,I have some knowledge on AI and how it uses information to come to decision ,8,100% none biased and based of facts alone,7,"I think provided absolutely all information is provided AI has the ability to make accurate, none biased and informed decisions",0,10,0,10,27,3,2,6,50,28,6

514,1,1,1,1,7,Since humans can be emotionally invested an AI could be making a better decision based on other facts,4,"I don't know for sure, but I guess it's based on all the available information from a patient",6,Yes and no. Yes: based on facts. No: based on lack of emotional investment,7,In cases like this I guess being emotionally invested is not always the best way to make a decision but at the same time some factors that are not hard facts but do play a big part could be left behind,3,9,3,9,26,2,2,3,30,0,7
322,1,1,1,1,9,The AI can do an analysis but it should always be up to a human to add sentiment into the decision making,4,"I understand the use but not the how, I'm not a computer engineer",7,"If evidence based, yes",8,It will learn over time so it must be a good machine by the time it used on a wider scale,10,0,10,0,30,5,1,6,14,1,6
468,2,4,8,1,8,"I see no reason why the Lead Officer shouldn't.

526,1,3,3,1,7,I think a well trained ai can use much more data in a shorter time than any human can.

676,2,3,7,1,6,The AI seems to take into account many factors which I believe would be pertinent to whether the person would need extra support on probation however computers are prone to glitches and also don't have the ability to see nuances like humans do and AI doesn't have the years of real life experience that police officers do. So I think a lot of police input should be involved and they shouldn't rely too heavily on AI. ,6,"On the previous page it was stated that age, sex, education level, behaviour in jail, previous crimes are all used to determine whether the person will need extra support. So I presume that AI will assess if a person falls into many high risk categories and from there decide whether they would require support or not. ",4,"I think potentially the AI relies too heavily on demographics, location etc to take into account personal differences and individuality ",4,I believe AI could be helpful in making these decisions as it could analyse a lot of data quickly but I don't believe it could ever live up to human intuition and personal knowledge of individuals which is even more valuable in making these decisions,8,8,7,7,23,2,2,6,4,90,8

465,2,3,7,1,6,The AI May give helpful information but human interaction is still the best judge of character ,8,It makes a decision based on a number of characteristics that have already been loaded or Pre programmed onto a system ,3,It is more of a stereotype than an accurate assessment ,5,I think it can go either way really.,1,1,1,1,28,3,2,7,40,60,1
508,1,3,3,2,7,"Even with those factors taken into account, there is always subtle differences between people who might get the same 'score' by the AI. It can however help the consultant to quickly categorize people in urgent and less urgent, and then make their own decision about who should and will be prioritized.",7,"I understand how AI's get trained, however, there will be a point where nobody knows exactly how the AI came to that decision.

1243,2,2,6,1,5,"AI is a helpful tool to make such decisions however, the lead officer should also listen to the other officers ",4,I do slightly understand how AI works,5,No feelings or opinions are involved. ,6,"Yes, because it is a collection of data ",8,3,3,6,24,5,2,5,10,10,6
728,2,2,6,1,9,The AI will make better decisions because it will strictly adhere to the stipulations of the rule of law.,7,The AI will work on already prescribed parameters to dispense of justice ,6,The AI is not prone to Making decisions that are biased due to emotional or fatigue ,6,The AI will make an unbiased decision regarding each casem,6,5,7,5,38,6,1,12,11,70,1
1880,2,1,5,1,8,Due to the level of computing power it is much easier for a computer to identify trends in past data and as AI gets smarter it can now interpret that data accurately and make decisions based upon it. However some responsibility needs to remain with the police department along with checking the AI has made the correct assumptions. ,5,I understand that AI identifies trends and uses that to predict future trends. Although how the algorithms are derived I think would require a much deeper understanding. ,7,Being a computer it doesn't incorporate any bias particularly if it develops the algorithms with no outside input which should make it fairer. ,8,"Based on the fairness and increased ability to identify trends, AI can be trusted, sometimes more than people. ",8,8,8,8,27,6,1,4,31,0,6
2297,2,2,6,1,7,Because it would be efficient and solve the problem of being understaffed.,4,I understand superficially that AI can be programmed by humans to make these decisions but I don‚Äôt really understand how it works,6,"It might be more fair than a person but if the creator of the AI‚Äôs code has bias, bias might be written into its system",8,I think so - again less bias than a person but only as good as it‚Äôs creator,4,4,7,7,30,8,2,7,8,9,6
228,1,2,2,2,6,I think they should take it into consideration as long as the AI has shown positive results in trials but it shouldn't be the only factor in their reasoning ,7,"Some AI is black box based and therefore, i don't completely understand how they come to some of their decisions ",5,there is still a lot of work to be done in making AI fair. Algorithmic bias is still rife and although there is research being done on it i don't think we're near enough to be able to say that AI is making fair decisions,5,"I'm not sure how it works, how explainable the AI is and the bias it might include ",7,6,7,6,23,5,2,1,40,52,4
425,1,4,4,1,6,Can assess data at a quicker rate without bias. But may be too clinical - these are people and there may be outside factors that have affected the data which may be important to know,8,It collects data from all patients using different categories (rated by importance) and adds them up to create a score for each patient. Patients will then be seen by order of score,8,It collects the same data on all individuals however why is sex important?,7,Unbiased however other factors may need to be considered - i.e. whether someone is an alcoholic ,3,5,10,5,22,3,2,4,2,9,6
329,1,1,1,1,3,i think that it can be helpful but ultimately it takes a human to decide what best for other humans. children should take priority and the AI may not be able to differentiate that.   ,5,i can only assume it looks at stats and the resources it would take to heal the person and an algorithm make the choice,8,"i believe it would be fair, but to  a fault. ",1,"no, because it does npot take outside circumstances into play, whether the patient is a child, parent, addict, etc.  ",7,10,8,7,31,4,1,6,50,19,6
438,2,3,7,1,3,A machine is a machine. A human understands a human better with emotions.,8,AI takes trends and patterns into account to have its algorithm make decisions.,5,it can be fair if a human always followed the same trends and patterns. But a human is a complex creature and can often be unpredictable.,3,"No, not always. AI wouldn't take irregular emotions into account. ",3,3,3,3,42,5,2,2,53,1,5
5262,1,2,2,1,10,There are many patients so it would make their workload much easier.,8,Through a neural network with different weights on different branches adjusted through the use of test data.,8,As long as suitable test data is used to initialise the AI it should not contain any significant bias.,7,Always have somebody check decisions for outliers or particularly sensitive cases.,5,7,5,7,23,6,2,3,50,51,6
